## Automating Photoshop
This is a brief blog post describing my experience with automating Photoshop using Python.
I am an experienced software developer, but had never really used Photoshop before.

Here's the [Adobe documentation](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf) my work was based on.

Here's a link to another [Github Project](https://github.com/loonghao/photoshop-python-api) that could also be of interest. I have not used there code, but it looks very promising.

### Some context
Some time ago we needed a solution to be able to quickly generate some product images using Photoshop.

The graphic designer wanted to combine 2 images into a final product image to be used for display their products online. 
- An environment image (PSD file).
- An object image (jpg).
- Combine the above images into a product image (jpg). 

This was done manually in Photoshop and as expected was very time consuming and error prone.
